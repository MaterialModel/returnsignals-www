# Return Signals

> Post-purchase concierge for every order. Return Signals uses AI over SMS to prevent returns before they happen.

Return Signals is an AI-powered platform that helps e-commerce brands reduce returns, improve customer experience, and optimize post-purchase operations.

## How It Works

### 1. Check In
A proactive SMS that feels human, not automated. We reach out to customers after purchase to ensure satisfaction.

### 2. Follow Up
If they haven't tried it yet, no problem. We'll reach out again later at the right time.

### 3. Resolve
Quick troubleshooting with customer-provided photos. We diagnose issues before they become returns.

### 4. Route
Need to exchange or return? Use photo evidence to decide: scrap at customer, ship for rework, or restock.

## The Problem We Solve

E-commerce returns are expensive and often preventable. Return Signals engages customers before they start a return, and when returns are inevitable, uses photo evidence to make intelligent item-level disposition decisions.

### Bad Fit (39% of returns)
**Problem:** Is the size wrong or are they wearing it wrong?
**Solution:** Proactive check-in to diagnose proper use and provide accurate size advice.

### Looks Different (28% of returns)
**Problem:** Do colors and fabric match photos?
**Solution:** Photo verification to see what customers see and confirm or flag the issue.

### Item is Damaged ($27 per return)
**Problem:** Loose thread or real problem?
**Solution:** Visual triage where photos confirm severity so you can decide without shipping.

### Blind Routing ($5 inspection and routing cost)
**Problem:** Every return takes the same expensive path.
**Solution:** Smart disposition to route by condition—restock, rework, or scrap.

## Real Examples

### Preventing Returns Through Problem-Solving
Jacky buys a wrap dress and gets a friendly fit check-in. She hasn't tried it yet, so Return Signals schedules a follow-up. When the neckline gaps, we suggest a quick adjustment and a simple fix, avoiding a return entirely.

### Making Smart Disposition Decisions
Bob's gym shirt looks great, until a run leaves a painful rub. Return Signals requests a quick photo, confirms a seam defect, and routes him straight to an exchange—no unnecessary shipping of defective products.

### Turning Complaints into Exchanges
Priya's leggings fit perfectly, but the color is darker than expected. Return Signals helps her articulate what she wants, sends a photo of a lighter option, and sets up an exchange that keeps the customer happy.
