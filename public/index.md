# Return Signals

> Post-purchase concierge for every order. Return Signals texts customers post‑delivery to provide support, convert returns into exchanges, and improve retention.

Return Signals is an AI-powered platform that helps e-commerce brands reduce returns, improve customer experience, and optimize post-purchase operations.

## How It Works

### 1. Check in
A proactive text that feels like a real associate.

### 2. Follow up
If they haven't tried it yet, no problem. We'll reach out again later.

### 3. Resolve
Support that saves the sale: fit & styling guidance, plus tailored exchange recommendations.

### 4. Exchange or return
Make it right in-thread. If a return is needed, use photos to decide: restock, rework, or keep‑it.

## Turn Returns Into Loyalty

When something isn't right, customers remember how you respond. Support after delivery is where repeat purchase is won.

### Fit Uncertainty (39% of return requests)
**Customer Signal:** Wrong size or cut for their preferences.
**Concierge Response:** Thoughtful personal sizing advice. Confirm the issue then recommend the best size or a better-fitting style.

### Expectation Mismatch (28% of return requests)
**Customer Signal:** Color or fabric not as expected.
**Concierge Response:** Check their photo, listen to their story. Help them find what they will love.

### Quality Concern ($27 avg. handling cost)
**Customer Signal:** Minor flaw or a real defect.
**Concierge Response:** Photo-based resolution. Decide the right fix: replace, rework, or keep-it.

**Outcome:** A good return experience leads to 3x more repeat purchases. The next purchase depends on how this one ends.

## Real Examples

### Preventing Returns Through Problem-Solving
Jacky buys a wrap dress and gets a friendly fit check-in. She hasn't tried it yet, so Return Signals schedules a follow-up. When the neckline gaps, we suggest a quick adjustment and a simple fix, avoiding a return entirely.

### Making Smart Disposition Decisions
Bob's gym shirt looks great, until a run leaves a painful rub. Return Signals requests a quick photo, confirms a seam defect, and routes him straight to an exchange—no unnecessary shipping of defective products.

### Turning Complaints into Exchanges
Priya's leggings fit perfectly, but the color is darker than expected. Return Signals helps her articulate what she wants, sends a photo of a lighter option, and sets up an exchange that keeps the customer happy.
