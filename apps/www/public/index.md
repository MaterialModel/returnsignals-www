# Return Signals

> Post-purchase concierge for every order. Return Signals texts customers post‑delivery to provide support, convert returns into exchanges, and improve retention.

Return Signals is an AI-powered platform that helps e-commerce brands reduce returns, improve customer experience, and optimize post-purchase operations.

## How It Works

### 1. Check in

A proactive text that feels like a real associate.

### 2. Follow up

If they haven't tried it yet, no problem. We'll reach out again later.

### 3. Resolve

Support that saves the sale: fit & styling guidance, plus tailored exchange recommendations.

### 4. Exchange or return

Make it right in-thread. If a return is needed, use photos to decide: restock, rework, or keep‑it.

## Customers Love Engaging with Return Signals

Real results from our customers.

### Key Metrics

- **60%** reply rate from happy customers
- **78%** reply rate from customers needing help
- **71%** of return requests resulted in exchanges

**Outcome:** A good return experience leads to 3x more repeat purchases. The next purchase depends on how this one ends.

## Real Examples

### Preventing Returns Through Problem-Solving

Jacky buys a wrap dress and gets a friendly fit check-in. She hasn't tried it yet, so Return Signals schedules a follow-up. When the neckline gaps, we suggest a quick adjustment and a simple fix, avoiding a return entirely.

### Making Smart Disposition Decisions

Bob's gym shirt looks great, until a run leaves a painful rub. Return Signals requests a quick photo, confirms a seam defect, and routes him straight to an exchange—no unnecessary shipping of defective products.

### Turning Complaints into Exchanges

Priya's leggings fit perfectly, but the color is darker than expected. Return Signals helps her articulate what she wants, sends a photo of a lighter option, and sets up an exchange that keeps the customer happy.

## Analytics Platform

Our analytics dashboard surfaces patterns in returns, complaints, and customer behavior, helping you reduce costs and improve products.
