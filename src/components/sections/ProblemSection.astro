        A customer gets their order. Maybe the neckline gaps. Maybe there's a
        loose thread. Maybe it looks different than the photos. They're not sure
        if it's a defect or just how it is.
      </p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">
        Most don't reach out. They return it—often a return that didn't need to
        happen—and you see "didn't fit" in your data. By the time you notice a
        pattern, you've already eaten the cost.
      </p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">
        When someone does have a real problem—a tear, a seam defect—they
        describe it over email. You can't see what they see. So you approve a
        return, pay to ship it back, inspect it, confirm it can't be resold, and
        throw it away. You could have known that from a photo before it ever
        left their house.
      </p>

      <p class="animate-on-scroll">
        Apparel returns run 25–35%. A lot of that is preventable—if you're not
        flying blind.
