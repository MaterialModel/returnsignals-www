    question: 'Is this a chatbot?',
    answer:
      "It's a post-purchase concierge over SMS that's tied to the order and focused on resolution (not generic Q&A).",
  },
  {
    question: 'What channels do you support?',
    answer: 'Starting with SMS + photo. (Email support is on the roadmap.)',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you handle edge cases?',
    answer:
      'We collect context up front and can escalate to a human when needed. The system is designed to handle common issues autonomously while knowing when to hand off.',
  },
  {
    question: 'How do you decide scrap vs return vs exchange?',
    answer:
      'Based on vendor policy and item economics, informed by at-customer visual inspection. You set the rules, we execute them intelligently.',
  },
  {
    question: 'What do brands get out of this besides fewer returns?',
    answer:
      'Earlier SKU-level signals and structured feedback before issues show up as returns or negative reviews. This helps you fix problems upstream.',
  },
