      "It's a post-purchase concierge over SMS that's tied to the order and focused on resolution (not generic Q&A).",
  },
  {
    question: "What channels do you support?",
    answer: "Starting with SMS + photo.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you handle edge cases?",
    answer:
      "We collect context up front and can escalate to a human when needed. The system is designed to handle common issues autonomously while knowing when to hand off.",
  },
  {
    question: "How do you decide scrap vs return vs exchange?",
    answer:
      "Based on vendor policy and item economics, informed by at-customer visual inspection. You set the rules, we execute them intelligently.",
  },
  {
    question: "What do brands get out of this besides fewer returns?",
    answer:
      "Earlier SKU-level signals and structured feedback before issues show up as returns or negative reviews. This helps you fix problems upstream.",
