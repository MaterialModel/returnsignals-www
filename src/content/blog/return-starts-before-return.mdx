In 2010, "customer support" was something you received if your problem fit neatly into a flowchart and your account was important enough to justify a human. Otherwise, you learned the quiet rule of the modern internet: most companies could not afford to talk to everyone, so they simply did not. Support was rationed, then disguised as self-serve, and the only way through the wall was persistence.

That scarcity shaped how customer experience was designed. The default interface became the ticket, the form, the inbox that answers when it can. Customers adapted by waiting until they were sure they were annoyed, because opening a ticket felt like starting a small legal case, and brands adapted by treating every inbound message as an expense to minimize.

Now AI is resetting the economics. Companies like <a href="https://sierra.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sierra</a> and <a href="https://decagon.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Decagon</a> are building agents that can handle customer conversations and <a href="https://openai.com/index/decagon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">take action inside real systems</a>, the kind of work that used to require large teams and a lot of training. Marginal interactions are getting cheaper, fast, and for the first time in ecommerce history it is realistic to offer something that resembles "a helpful associate" to every customer, not just to the customers who complain the loudest.

And yet most of the industry is rebuilding the same old thing with new machinery. AI gets bolted onto the ticket queue. Brands celebrate faster response times and higher deflection, but the customer still has to raise their hand first, still has to write the story first, still has to become frustrated enough to initiate contact. It is skeuomorphic CX: the shape of support designed for scarcity, preserved even after scarcity stops being the binding constraint.

The problem is that dissatisfaction rarely begins at the moment a ticket is created. The ticket is the paperwork at the end.

## Returns have become too large to treat as a back-office issue

If you run ecommerce, you already feel the pressure, but it helps to say the numbers out loud because they explain why "do nothing" is not a strategy anymore. The National Retail Federation (NRF) and Happy Returns projected that U.S. retail returns would total <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-and-happy-returns-report-2024-retail-returns-total-890-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>$890 billion in 2024</strong></a>, or <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-and-happy-returns-report-2024-retail-returns-total-890-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>16.9% of annual sales</strong></a>. In the same report, <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-and-happy-returns-report-2024-retail-returns-total-890-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>76% of consumers said free returns are a key factor in deciding where to shop</strong></a>.

Those facts create a trap. Customers have been trained to expect returns that are easy and cheap, but returns are a direct attack on margin and on operational attention. Retailers respond by tightening policies, adding fees, shrinking windows, pushing store credit. Customers notice, and the brand pays for it later, usually in the quiet form of lower repeat purchase and higher acquisition spend. NRF has also reported that <a href="https://nrf.com/media-center/press-releases/nrf-and-happy-returns-report-2024-retail-returns-total-890-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>67% of consumers say a negative return experience would discourage them from shopping with that retailer again</strong></a>.

The temptation is to frame returns as moral failure. Customers are "abusing" policies. Bracketing is "out of control." Sometimes that is true. But the better frame for apparel is simpler: many returns are an information failure. The customer did not know how it would fit, how it would look in their lighting, how it would feel on their skin, or whether the small annoyance they noticed is "normal" or "defective." They discover those answers at home, and in that moment they decide what your brand means.

## In apparel, the decision happens in the mirror

Apparel returns are not usually triggered by a catastrophic problem. They are triggered by mismatch, the subtle gap between what the customer pictured and what reality delivered. PowerReviews found that <a href="https://www.powerreviews.com/research/apparel-shopping-trends-2023/merchandise-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>39% of consumers return apparel because they don't like the way it fits</strong></a>, and <a href="https://www.powerreviews.com/research/apparel-shopping-trends-2023/merchandise-returns/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>28% return because the item didn't look the way they thought it would</strong></a>. That lines up with what every operator sees in reason codes: fit uncertainty and expectation mismatch are the daily weather.

Then the economics arrive like gravity. Radial estimates <a href="https://www.radial.com/insights/returns-management-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>it costs merchants an average of $27 to process a return for a $100 ecommerce order</strong></a>, and that <a href="https://www.radial.com/insights/returns-management-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>only 30% of returned merchandise is ever resold</strong></a>, with the rest going to donation, liquidation, or disposal. In other words, returns are not just refunds. They are shipping, handling, inspection, repackaging, lost time, and often lost inventory value.

So apparel brands end up with a brutal balancing act. A frictionless return policy supports conversion and reduces hesitation at checkout, but once the customer forms the desire to return, almost any attempt to "intervene" can feel like friction, the kind that tells the customer the brand cares more about protecting margin than protecting the relationship.

That is why timing matters. The best moment to help is not after the customer has decided, it is before the decision crystallizes.

## What if the brand spoke first

Return Signals exists because we think the industry is solving the wrong problem. The goal is not merely to process tickets cheaply. The goal is to catch dissatisfaction earlier, while it is still soft, while the customer still wants the item to work, while the brand still has room to be helpful without sounding defensive.

Return Signals is a post-purchase concierge that texts customers after delivery, checks in like a real associate would, follows up if they have not tried the item yet, and resolves issues in-thread with fit guidance, styling help, and tailored exchange recommendations. If a return is needed, photos make the outcome smarter: restock when it makes sense, rework when it is fixable, and sometimes "keep it" when shipping it back is just paying money to learn the same lesson twice.

The simplest way to understand the product is to picture the moment your existing systems miss.

A customer buys a dress on Monday. The package arrives on Wednesday. She does not try it on that night because she is busy, and she does not try it on Thursday because she forgets, and by Friday she is slightly anxious because she has an event coming up. This is the emotional prequel to a return, and it is invisible to ticket-based support because nothing has happened yet.

Then a text shows up: a gentle check-in that assumes the brand is present after delivery, not absent. She replies that she has not tried it yet. The system does not punish her for that. It simply follows up later. When she finally tries it on and notices the neckline gapes, she is not forced to translate that feeling into a formal complaint. She can describe it in plain language, share a photo if needed, and get an answer that moves the situation forward.

Sometimes the answer is a small fix. Sometimes it is reassurance that the garment is meant to sit a certain way. Sometimes it is an exchange into the right size, or into a different cut that matches her preferences. The important part is that the customer experiences the brand as attentive before she experiences it as adversarial.

## Why "AI support" does not automatically earn trust

One reason proactive concierge matters is that customers are increasingly skeptical of automation in customer service, and for good reason. A lot of AI-first support has been deployed as a gate, not as help.

Gartner reported that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-09-gartner-survey-finds-64-percent-of-customers-would-prefer-that-companies-didnt-use-ai-for-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>64% of customers would prefer companies didn’t use AI for customer service</strong></a>, and that <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2024-07-09-gartner-survey-finds-64-percent-of-customers-would-prefer-that-companies-didnt-use-ai-for-customer-service" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>53% would consider switching to a competitor if they found out a company was going to use AI for customer service</strong></a>. Read that again. The concern is not "AI exists." The concern is that AI will become another obstacle between the customer and a real outcome.

Proactive concierge changes that emotional framing. The customer is not fighting their way into a system. The brand is showing up early and offering assistance in a channel that feels natural and low effort. If you do it well, it reads less like automation and more like attentiveness.

## The ROI story is not one story, it is three

Brands often talk about returns as if the only win is "prevent the return." Prevention is valuable, but it is not the only lever that matters, and it is not always the right lever. Return Signals' ROI methodology models three kinds of value: converting returns into exchanges, preventing returns by helping customers keep the item, and improving retention because the customer feels heard and helped.

In practice, those three buckets map to real outcomes you can picture.

First, there is the customer who is unhappy but still wants the product category, and what she really needs is the right size or the right style. If you convert her refund into an exchange, you preserve revenue and you preserve the relationship, while paying the incremental cost of shipping and inventory to make it right.

Second, there is the customer who is wobbling for a small reason, a waistband that feels odd until you adjust it, a fabric that reads differently indoors than in sunlight, a minor issue that is fixable if someone takes five minutes to talk her through it. If she keeps the item, you avoid the return processing cost and you keep the original sale, which can be meaningfully better than taking the item back just to resell it at a discount.

Third, there is retention, the part many teams undercount because it does not show up on the day the return is created. HBR cites Bain research suggesting <a href="https://hbr.org/2014/10/the-value-of-keeping-the-right-customers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>increasing customer retention rates by 5% increases profits by 25% to 95%</strong></a>, depending on the business. Narvar reported that <a href="https://corp.narvar.com/blog/emotion-driven-ecommerce" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>70% of consumers say an easy return or exchange is likely to make them a repeat customer</strong></a>. The point is not that every intervention creates a lifelong fan. The point is that post-purchase resolution is one of the clearest moments when a brand can either earn another purchase or quietly lose it.

## The bet Return Signals is making

Ecommerce leaders have spent the last decade optimizing the front of the funnel, and it worked. Better PDPs, better merchandising, better checkout, faster delivery. But the customer's relationship with an apparel brand often begins after delivery, when the customer tries something on and decides whether the brand understands them.

AI is making support cheaper. That part is obvious. What is still underappreciated is that when support becomes abundant, you can redesign the experience around timing instead of around defense.

Return Signals is betting that the next advantage in apparel is proactive post-purchase engagement, the kind that reaches out before the return decision hardens, when interventions can feel like care instead of friction. The financial upside comes from converting refunds into exchanges, helping customers keep items they would have returned for fixable reasons, and improving retention by turning a potentially disappointing moment into a moment of responsiveness. The brand upside is quieter but just as real: customers feel listened to, and in apparel that feeling is often the difference between "I'm done with this brand" and "I'll give them another shot."

Because the return starts before the return, and that is where you still have leverage.
